/*
Key points:
- Kotlin Multiplatform is a new and fast-growing approach to cross-platform and development.
- KMP lets you share Kotlin code between iOS, Android, web, server, and more.
- There are a number of advantages to KMP, including developer familiarity with Kotlin, native performance, native UI
code, and the consolidation of your app business logic into a shared module across all platforms.
- You use the expect and actual keywords to create a common interface within the shared code that relies on concrete
implementations on different platforms as needed.
