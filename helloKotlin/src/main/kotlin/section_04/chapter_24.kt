/*
Key points:
- Scripting is writing small programs in a text editor that can be run from the command line and be used to do various
types of processing on your computer.
- As a scripting language, Kotlin gives you the static-typing lacking in other scripting languages like Python and Ruby.
- Kotlin comes with a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop or REPL that can be used to investigate Kotlin code in an interactive
manner.
- Kotlin scripts end with the extension .kts, as opposed to normal Kotlin code that ends with .kt.
- You can use Intellij IDEA as a script editor, and then either run your scripts within the IDE or from a command line
shell on your OS.
- Kotlin scripts run inside a hidden main() function and can access args passed into the script at the command line.
Scripts can also import Kotlin and Java libraries to access their features.
- You can use Kotlin scripts to read and write to the files and folders on your filesystem, and much more!
