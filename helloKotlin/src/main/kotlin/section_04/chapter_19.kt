/*
Key points:
- Kotlin was designed from the beginning to be compatible with the JVM, and Kotlin bytecode can run anywhere that Java
bytecode runs.
- You can intermix Kotlin and Java code within on project.
- It's possible to add Kotlin extension functions to classes written in Java, and also to call Kotlin free functions
from Java code.
- Annotations like @JvmOverloads and @JvmStatic help you integrate your Java and Kotlin code.
