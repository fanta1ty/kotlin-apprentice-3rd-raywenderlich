/*
Key points:
- Computers, at their most fundamental level, perform simple mathematics.
- A programming language allows you to write code, which the compiler converts into instructions that the CPU can
execute. Kotlin code on the JVM is first converted to bytecode.
- Computers operate on numbers in base 2 form, otherwise known as binary.
- Code comments are denoted by a line starting with // or multiple lines bookended with /* and */.
- Code comments can be used to document your code.
- You can use println to write things to the console area.
- The arithmetic operators are:
    Add: +
    Subtract: -
    Multiply: *
    Divide: /
    Remainder: %
- Constants and variables give names to data.
- Once you've declared a constant, you can't change its data, but you can change a variable's data at any time.
- Always give variables and constants meaningful names to save yourself and your colleagues headaches later.
- Operators to perform arithmetic and then assign back to the variable.
    Add and assign: +=
    Subtract and assign: -=
    Multiply and assign: *=
    Divide and assign: /=
